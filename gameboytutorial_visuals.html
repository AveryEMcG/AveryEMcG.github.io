                In the gameboy, there are two important graphical elements - tiles, and sprites.<br>
                <img src="img/tilemap.png" alt="an image of several squares, intending to show a group of tiles" class="pico8Image", style="display:inline-block"></img>
                <img src="img/sprite1.png" alt="an image of a circle, intending to show a sprite", style="display:inline-block"></img>
                <br><br>
                Tiles are square pixel art images, intended to be laid together in order to make a background for a game. These  tiles are organized into groups called 'tilemaps' and then Sprites are drawn on top of these maps to create the impression of an object or character existing in a world.

                The gameboy (using some strategies with memory we will discuss later) views a segment of the map and displays it on screen. The designer may choose to make the map bigger than the visual field of the gameboy screen, this can be used to create scrolling effects by slowly moving the perspective of the screen across the tilemap.<br>
                <img src="img/gameboy_with_tiles.png" class="pico8Image" alt="an image showing a series of background tiles, with a few circular sprites floating on top. A gameboy floats above the whole scene, with the circles and tiles appearing onscreen as a unified picture. A cone representing the field of view of the gameboy shines down onto the tilemap, showing that one of the sprites and part of the tilemap is offscreen to the player and thus not seen.">
