            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a> is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in theoretical computer science. 
            In basic terms, the problem analyzes how one could prove whether or not a program will eventually finish running, or is trapped in an infinite cycle somewhere. 
            I don't pretend to know the halting solution, but I really like it as a moniker.

            I avoid using fancy formatting on my pages, because it becomes <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">less accessible</a>, 
            especially for people who use screenreaders when accessing the internet.
