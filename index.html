            <i>Why the name?</i><br><br>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a> is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in theoretical computer science. 
            In basic terms, the problem analyzes how one could prove whether or not a program will eventually finish running, or is trapped in an infinite cycle somewhere. 
            I don't pretend to know the halting solution, but I really like it as a moniker.
