        <h2>History of Counting</h2>
        <h3>Numbers on the body</h3>

        Since humans first walked the earth, we've sought to understand our environment. Anthropologists believe that
        counting developed alongside language in early hominids. Early artifacts of stone and bone show hatch marks
        which appear to denote quantities.<br><br>

        <div class="essayPictureContainerRight">
            <img src="img/12_count.png" style="width:100%"
                alt="an image of two hands with numbers at each finger joint, the hand on the right shows a thumb pointing to the digit 1 on the first finger joint on the first finger.">
        </div>
        In each culture, a different way of counting developed. In most of Europe, Asia, and some parts of the Americas,
        people counted their fingers and thus worked in base 10. In our modern culture this leads to complication when
        dealing with time and angles which operate against 12, 60, and 32. Early mathematical scholars in Northern
        Africa and the Middle East counted in units of 12, pressing their thumbs to each joint in the fingers rather
        than raising their fingers one by one.
        <br><br>
        These mathmaticians divided the sundial into 12 units (the other 12 being units of darkness) to give us the 24
        hour day. The circle was counted with 30 units of 12, making 360.
        <br><br>
        In two of great empires of the Americas, the Maya and Aztec counted both their fingers and their toes - leading
        to base 20. Each month in both civilizations was divided into groups of 20 days, and had a cyclical ritual
        timeline of 260 days (20*13) where each month was ruled over by a specific diety. Years however were divided up
        into 365 days to correspond to the cyclical patterns of seasons, day length, and celestial movements. These
        civilizations also independently discovered and used the number 0 in their calculations, perhaps being the first
        to do so.

        </div>

        Base 10 meanwhile was used in the Incan Empire, and calculations were essential to their advanced systems of
        taxations and resource allocations. The Incans developed a system of encoding numbers through knotted strings
        called a Quipu. Researchers also believe that the Quipu recorded abstract information such as military
        organization and census data. <br><br>
        Tragically the histories of these civilizations was purposefully destroyed by European colonists. The quipus and
        codexes burned, the aztec stonework demolished. <br><br>It took centuries after this cultural purge for Eurpean
        archeologists to recognize that the carved stonework of the aztecs represented meaningful information rather
        than arbitrary images. It took yet another century to realize their writing was phonetic - like the english
        alphabet - and that the complex figures depicting letters were elaborate creative motifs, not unlike the array
        of fonts and illuminated manuscripts of europe.
        <br><br>We will never recover the full extent of what these peoples saught to record to history, aside from what
        we continue to uncover from their artifacts, and the legacy protected and carried forward by those of us who
        count themselves as their decendants.<br><br>

        <h3>Encoding numbers, and early digital computers</h3>

            <i>The number 70 depicted in base 10 gears, (7x10^1) + (0x10^0)</i>
        </div>
        The quipu was one of many systems humans have developed to assist in counting and calculation which extend
        beyond the body - such as the soroban, abacus, slide rule, counting cloth, and cuneiform. The familiar
        Hindu-Arabic numeral system (0-9) allows for incredible ease in calculation through writing (unlike roman
        numerals).
        <br><br>
        Early attempts at general purpose computers saught to represent base 10 numbers in mechanical devices, requiring
        aligned systems of gears on powers of 10. Babbage's analytical engine used this layout, and paid the price for
        it. All of these gears required specialized hand-craftsmanship. They often locked up and fell out of sync. The
        complication and cost proved too much for the analytical engine to be built.

        </div>
        The Zuse computer's base 2 operation was able to rely instead on single units either being in one state or another. This could be represented with something as simple as an on-off switch - an incredible step towards simplicity in mechanical design.

        Once computers switched to binary (base 2) a wide array of physical implementations followed. Some are nearly
        unrecognizable as encoding systems today. For example, tubes of mercury were tilted up and down and the waves
        recorded as ones and troughs as zeroes(mercury being conductive made these easily measurable). Strands of wire
        were sewn into complex nettings to create read-only memory (ROM) which permanently encoded binary digits into
        squares of metallic mesh or ropes(<a
            href="http://www.righto.com/2019/07/software-woven-into-wire-core-rope-and.html">the software for the Apollo
            spacecraft was hand-sewn in this manner</a>).

        </div>Potentially the oddest encoding of binary was the guitar string. A twist of the wire would represent a 1,
        and an un-twist as a 0. These and the mercury tubes actually served as a specific kind of computer memory called
        "delay line", which would store data for a specific duration of time - the duration being dictated by the
        medium, such as length of wire or tubing.

        <br><br>

        Through all of these examples, we can see that the encoding of numbers is arbitrary. It could be a finger, a
        knot in a string, a gear in a certain position, or a switch. What's important is that a person can both write
        these numbers into the system of choice, and can also read them back (encoding, and decoding). Once that is
        possible, an appropriate system of numbers and encoding can be chosen for a given application.
        <br><br>The Selection of Binary encoding for computing opens the doors to complex systems of electricity-based
        calculations known as 'logic gates', which live throughout computer systems but are densely packed into a part
        of a CPU known as the "Arithmatic Logic Unit" or ALU (some CPU's may also have multiple ALUs for various
        purposes). In the next sections, these logic gates and logical units are described in detail.
