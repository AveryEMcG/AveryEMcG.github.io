        <h2>Pico-8 Tutorial - The Basics</h2>
        <i>Note: this page is a work in progress</i><br><br>
        This tutorial is intended for those opening the pico-8 editor for the first time, in order to becoming acquainted with the larger ideas behind the console.
        <h3>High Level Concepts</h3>
        <i>What is Pico-8?</i><br><br>
        <div style="padding-left:2%">
        <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" style="color:black;">Pico-8</a> is a "fantasy console", which means it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" style="color: black;" >virtual machine</a> for a computer system which never existed. The design is intended to mimic old computers such as the commodore-64 which had highly constrained resources. 
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <i>Why would developers want to limit their resources?</i><br>
        <div style="padding-left:2%">
        <ul>
            <li> <i>Constraints provide creative opportunity</i> - many painters choose a subset of colors, writers experiment with strict formats such as rhyming or iambic pentameter. By limiting choices, the mind is forced to think "outside the box" and imagine new solutions and forms of expression.
            </li>
            <br><li> <i>Narrowing of focus cuts the inessential</i> - if you are limited by the number of sprites in a game, you'll have to consider what characters are important. A ceiling on program size enforces the developer to reject low-value additions to the program.
            </li>
            <br><li> <i>Finite size avoids 'endless projects'</i> - by having a hard cutoff, a game cannot continue to grow indefinitely, or have an unrealistic scope.</li>

            <br><li> <i>Simplified problems are better learning opportunities</i> - educators know that giving manageable sized problems allows for students to achieve feelings of both challenge, struggle, and eventual success and mastery. By reducing the options for implementation, new learners are able to make greater strides more quickly and eventually graduate to more complex systems as they achieve full comprehension. (This is similar to the reasoning behind the simplified programming language of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language" style="color: black;">Scratch</a>)
            </li>
            
        </ul>
