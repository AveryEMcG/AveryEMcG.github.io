            <h2>An Introduction</h2>
    
    
            There is undue mystery in the operation of computers. For some reason, digital technology is seen as magical or
            too advanced to be understood by the layperson. This is not true. Computers are glorified engines or plumbing
            systems - they're complicated, but anyone with some attention and effort can learn its principles and
            operations. To begin our understanding, we will begin at the heart of the machine and work our way outward.

            <h3>CPU - the heart of a computer</h3>

                    style="width:100%;">
                <div style="text-align:center" class="fontCorrect"><i>An example power reading from somewhere on a computer
                        chip, showing high and low signals over time.</i>
                </div>
    
            </div>
            All modern
            computers have a central hub where all data flows, we generally call that the computer chip or CPU (which stands
            for Central Processing Unit). Like
            water pressure through a pipe, electricity flows through this chip - when the electricity has higher power we
            call it a 1 (or True) and when it's low we call it 0 (or False). If you were to take an electric sensor and put
            it somewhere on a chip, you would see the power rise up and fall down eratically as the data is passed around.
            <br><br>
            The chip has many places where this electricity
            flows. There are many units in a CPU and each performs a specialized job, such as adding two numbers together or
            collecting data from somewhere else. At each of these places, the unit spends a duration of time listening to
            the electricity and performing its work. Because of these time-sensitive tasks, the whole system
            must be very tightly choreographed. <br><br>
    
    
            To synchronize everything, all parts of the chip listen to a clock which ticks off time at a very precise (and
            <i>incredibly</i> fast) rate. These ticks aren't used to measure periods of time, just to set a pace - so it's
            more like a metronome than a watch! This mentronome-clock is made by passing electricity through a quartz
            crystal, which causes the crystal to shake at a predictable speed. Every time the crystal completes an
            oscillation (the shake), each part of the chip knows to perform its next step and pass the electricity to the
            next
            unit in the system (this is done by re-broadcasting what it heard - a zero or a 1 - to the next person in the
            cpu pipe).

            <div style="text-align:center"><i>This is a very zoomed in picture of the inside of a <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004">intel 4004</a> chip - the first computer chip on the
                    market (thanks MIT for releasing this picture!). If you look closely, you can see all the little paths
                    the electricity must take, and the units where that electricity is processed.</i></div><br><br>
            So now we have a few basic ideas:
            <ul>
                <li>Computers have a core called a CPU where all processing occurs</li>
                <li>CPUs operate with electricty passing along special routes</li>
                <li>These routes connect different electronic parts which do different jobs</li>
                <li>When the electricity is high, the computer considers it a 1</li>
                <li>When the electricity is low, the computer considers it a 0</li>
                <li>the whole system is synchronized with a highly accurate clock</li>
            </ul>
