             The other day I was walking around NYC, completely parched, with an empty water bottle. I found it nearly impossible to figure out where the closest water fountain would be. Eventually, I discovered there were some commercial apps available, which seemed unnecessary considering the sheer amount of public municiple data available on the internet.
			 <br><br>
			 I had used <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Maps</a> and <a href="https://openlayers.org">Open Layers</a> in the past to draw features on top of maps. I figured this would be an easy way to resolve some location data onscreen.
			 <br><br>
			 Initially I derived my data from the <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">New York City Open Data Port</a>, but found it remarkably difficult to work with 
             for the data points I was extracting, and not particularly reliable. A friend recommended the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags"> Open Street Maps
              Tagging System</a>, as it was community driven and open source. Using the front-end tool <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu"> Overpass Turbo</a> I was able to 
              perform some basic queries, and download the result as geojson data (which is embedded directly into the page).
