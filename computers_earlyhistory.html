        <h2>The Early History of Computers</h2>
        A central idea in computing theory is that information can be used to represent data or instructions - sort of
        like how the human voice can be used to describe something, or to tell someone what to do. All of the
        information in modern computers are stored in the format of zeroes and ones.

        People sometimes make the mistake of assuming zeroes and ones (also known as binary) is somehow special.
        (<i>psst, it's not!</i>) The first computers actually used the numbers 0-9, and that history is a really useful
        tool for understanding how modern computers work. In fact, it was this early dependence on base 10 which killed
        the first computers before they had the chance to mature into a useful machine. <br><br>

        The precursor to computers were completely unrelated to calcuation - they were actually specialized kinds of
        industrial looms. Making fabric patterns requires a very complicated organization of colored thread to be woven
        together perfectly. Automated looms created in the early 19th century used cards with holes punched in them
        (punch cards) to mechanically shift what threads were placed where.

        <br><br> This machine was so advanced, it was an early form of automation which replaced the occupational roles
        many skilled laborors. In 1811 those workers began burning the looms in protest, and became known as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">the luddites</a>, which to this day is used as a term to mean
        someone who is against technological progress. The question of production, labor, and automation, have always
        been embedded within computing - even in its progenitor the loom.

        <br><br>The luddites launched the loom into public awareness - including the salons of the upper clases, where
        aristocratic scholars could meet and share ideas. Charles Babbage was one such elite. In the loom, he saw the
        potential to connect his understanding of engines and mathematics to make a mechanical device which could solve
        math problems. Rather than punchcards representing threads, they could instead be used to represent numbers and
        mathematical operations which the loom could then solve like an abacus. He called his device the Analytical
        Engine.
        <br><br>
        As Babbage worked on his mechanical designs, he recruited the young socialite Ada Lovelace to formulate how the
        punchcards would operate. Lovelace was a mathematical prodigy and the daughter of Lord Byron (Her mother
        suffering a falling out with Byron, insisted her daughter learn mathematics - the furthest discipline from
        poetry she could conceive of), and is now thought of as the first computer programmer.
        <br><br>

        The analytical engine was never built - the hand made parts were cumbersome and expensive and government
        financing ceased prior to the assembly of a prototype. Similar to the arabic numeral system we are familiar
        with, his machine was in base 10. This required a complicated gearing system with 10 settings for each digit.
        Although we find it easier to operate in the world with ten digits, it was a structural hurdle which fatally
        complicated the analyitcal engine's design.

        <br><br>Those needing to perform simple calculation continued to
        rely on abacuses, slide rules, and other such handheld tools which though simple proved reliable and easy to
        make. It wasn't for another century that attention would return to the general-purpose computer.

        In 1930's Germany, Konrad Zuse built the first binary computer. Instead of focusing on a gearing system which
        suited our familiarity with base 10 counting, he simplified numbers to instead suit the machine. By developing
        his mechanisms to use base two, Zuse only needed to represent two numbers for each digit - a zero and a one.
        Having only two setting to support instead of ten opened the door to the numerous implementations of computers
        we have since seen.
        <br><br>
        <div style="padding-left:2%">
        <i>As an aside:
            Interestingly not unlike Babbage, Zuse lost his government funding due to the belief that his machine did
            not
            have strategic importance. The Third Reich felt that between their hand calculations and the enigma machine
            (an
            early encryption tool), no further investment in computation or ciphers was necessary for the war effort.
            The
            Allies thought differently, and broke Enigma using their own early proto-computer known as the Bombe. Also
            at this time, people imprisoned at Auschwitz were tatooed with IBM identification numbers. Both blessings and horrors have forever followed the wake of calculation machines.

        So why did switching to binary produce more efficient calcuating machines? We'll cover that in the next essay,
        which focuses on how humans count numbers and why computers use base 2.
