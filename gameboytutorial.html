        <h2>Introduction to Gameboy Development</h2>

        Here you can find a series of essays on how to develop gameboy games.<br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>  
        <div style="padding-left:2%">
        The gameboy is a handheld gaming console released in the late 80's. Emulators now exist which can run games including new games developed entirely for that virtual system (or for die-hard fans with money to burn, small-batch manufactured games). This means that the gameboy is an excellent vehicle for learning about low level, resource constrained, and single-purpose systems.

             I use and recommend the <a href="https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds"> RGBDS toolchain</a> for assembling code, <a href="https://github.com/Rangi42/tilemap-studio">Tilemap studio</a> and <a href="https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama"> Pixelorama</a> for generating pixel art, and finally </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">VIM</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geany"> geany</a> for programming.
            <br>
            <br>The <a href ="https://gbdev.io/">GB Dev</a> community (especially the discord chat) is incredibly valuable in working through this process. I strongly recommend anyone interested in the topic to start there.
